# Grunt-Setup
Sample Grunt Setup for simple tasks.

This grunt configuration was made following Matt Bailey's Beginners Guide to Grunt.

It will optimize images, compile sass, validate and make your javascripts ugly, and serves as a task watcher. Place all working files in the following directory structure:
<br>src/images
<br>src/scripts
<br>src/styles

Clean currently is set to not delete /dist directory upon start. It's not efficient to start from scratch everytime grunt isn't run as standalone.
